KEDS - The Kansas Event Data System

Background
This system uses automated coding of English-language news reports to generate political event data focusing on the Middle East, Balkans, and West Africa. These data are used in statistical early warning models to predict political change. The ten-year projected is based in the Department of Political Science at the University of Kansas; it has been funded primarily by the U.S. National Science Foundation.

Levant data set: Folder containing WEIS-coded events(N=196337) for dynamic interactions within the following set of countries: Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestinians, Syria, USA, and USSR/Russia. Coverage is April 1979 to June 2004. TABARI coding dictionaries are also included.
