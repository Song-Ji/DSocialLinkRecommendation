KEDS - The Kansas Event Data System

Background
This system uses automated coding of English-language news reports to generate political event data focusing on the Middle East, Balkans, and West Africa. These data are used in statistical early warning models to predict political change. The ten-year projected is based in the Department of Political Science at the University of Kansas; it has been funded primarily by the U.S. National Science Foundation.

Balkans data set, 1989-2003: Folder containing WEIS-coded events(N=78667) for the major actors(including ethnic groups) involved in the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. Coverage is April 1989 through July 2003. TABARI coding dictionaries are included in the folder. There are some errors(197) in data set - relation codes become 000, 024, 053 in Balkan.dat. Some events don't have description codes - they are marked with *** in relation labels in *.net files.
