Facebook-like Forum Network

The Facebook-like Forum Network was attained from the same online community as the online social network; however, the focus in this network is not on the private messages exchanged among users, but on usersâ€™ activity in the forum. The forum represents an interesting two-mode network among 899 users and 522 topics in that a weight can be assigned to the ties based on the number of messages or characters that a user posted to a topic.

Primary Nodes 899
Secondary Nodes 522
Time-Stamped ties 33720
